# Requesting a role
As a moderator and manager of a large discord server there are situations where you need high privilege roles and permissions to do your job.
However, having these roles and permissions always on your account, or having the ability to join a role which such privileges, can expose the community to risk and harm.
Your account might be hacked and that might cause unintended and unwanted changes to the community.

As such this bot gives you an opportunity to get access to a role with high privileges, reducing the risk to the community,
and ensuring that all accounts and moderators operate on the same level of trust and privileges in their day-to-day operations.

## Using the bot to request a role
Running the command `/pim request` in a channel in which the bot resides will start the request process.
You will need to supply two pieces of information:
1. The role you want to enable
2. The reason why you need the role.

This will create an approval thread which other members of your community will be able to approve.

:::warning
You are not able to approve or reject your own requests.
:::

## Role activation
Once another member of your community has approved the request you will receive a direct message indicating as such.
If you need multiple roles active you will need to send multiple different requests.
